# Line-bot-OPGG
Welcome to the OPGG Line Bot repository, an interactive chatbot for Line that provides real-time player statistics and information from the OPGG website for League of Legends players. This bot is designed to quickly fetch and display users' gaming stats, match history, and rankings directly within the Line messaging app, making it easier for gamers to track their performance and stay updated with their stats.
